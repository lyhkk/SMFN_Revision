**Here to put video datasets**

**Suggestions**:

1. Don’t use videos that are too long,2 or 3 seconds is enough.
2. ERP format suits the project’s need(because **the detection Indicators** put heavier weights in equatorial direction of the frame picture),but it doesn’t mean it’s a better choice comparing with sphere format
